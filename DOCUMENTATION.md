# Drag-and-Drop Dashboard Development Plan
## Overview
The core functionality allows users to create personalized dashboards by dragging and dropping various modules, 
such as charts, graphs, and tables, which can be linked to different data sources.

### Key Features & Implementation Strategy
1. Drag-and-Drop Interface
   Technology: Vue Grid Layout
   Approach: Implement Vue Grid Layout to create a flexible grid system where users can drag and drop dashboard modules. Each module will be a Vue component that can be resized and repositioned within the grid.
2. Customization Options
   Technology: Vue 3 Component Props, Vuex
   Approach: Develop interactive settings panels for each module type, allowing users to customize aspects like color schemes and visualization types. Use Vuex to manage the state of these settings globally.
3. Data Integration
   Technology: Axios, Laravel API
   Approach: Use Axios for API requests to the Laravel backend to fetch data from various sources (CSV uploads, database queries, third-party APIs). Implement backend logic in Laravel to handle these data integrations.
4. Real-time Updates
   Technology: WebSocket
   Approach: Utilize an existing WebSocket server to push real-time data updates to the frontend. Ensure each module subscribes to relevant data streams and updates its content dynamically.
5. User Authentication
   Technology: Laravel Auth, Sanctum, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   Approach: Implement a secure authentication system using Laravel's built-in Auth capabilities, enhanced with JWT for API authentication. Control access to dashboard creation and modification based on user roles and permissions.
6. Export and Sharing
   Technology: jsPDF, FileSaver.js
   Approach: Enable dashboard export functionality using jsPDF for PDF generation and FileSaver.js for saving files. Implement sharing capabilities by generating shareable links or enabling dashboard exports to be sent via email.

### Tech Stack Rationale
#### Vue 3:
Chosen for its reactivity and composition API, suitable for building dynamic, interactive UIs.
#### Vue Grid Layout: 
Ideal for creating a flexible drag-and-drop grid system.
#### Laravel API:
Provides a robust backend framework for handling data operations, authentication, and integration with various data sources.
#### WebSocket:
Essential for real-time data communication, keeping the dashboard updated with the latest information.
#### Vuex:
Manages state across components, particularly useful for maintaining customization settings.
#### Axios:
Handles API requests efficiently and integrates seamlessly with Vue.
#### JWT:
Securely manages user sessions and API access.
 
### Development Milestones
### Setup and Initial Configuration
Set up Vue 3 project with required dependencies (Vue Grid Layout, Vuex, Axios).
Configure Laravel API endpoints for user authentication and data retrieval.
